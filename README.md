# HR Data Engine (Backend)
Bridging the gap between HRMS UI/UX Design and Relational Data Architecture.

## 🚀 Background & Inspiration
Drawing from my extensive experience as a UI/UX Designer at FlexSystem, where I worked on the BridgeBuilder HRMS , 
I realized that a great user experience starts with a robust data foundation. This project is a full-stack implementation of a scalable HR data engine, 
transitioning from designing responsive HR modules to architecting the underlying database logic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Runtime: Node.js 
- Web Framework: Express.js 
- Database: MySQL (Relational Database Management) 
- Tools: MySQL Workbench, Postman
